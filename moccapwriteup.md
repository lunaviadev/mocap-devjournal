# MOCAP WRITEUP

## Week 1 - Planning & Script Writing

### Chosen Genre: Comedy

---

When it came to deciding what genre we wanted to do, comedy was a pretty much unanimous vote. Everyone pretty quickly decided that going for something that didn't take itself too seriously meant that we could get away with a lot more goofy and wacky antics in our shot and really play into the creative side of comedy with out of pocket jokes that would have the audience in tears after seeing our short film.

Looking through the different genres of comedy: Slapstick, Dark, Romantic, Satire, Parody, Mockumentry and various other genres we brainstormed a couple ideas that we wanted to pitch to the rest of the class to gain input on.

Our two most prominent ideas were 'Devil's Tango' a short where a man recieves a text from his partner expecting to do the devil's tango with her though upon entering their bedroom finds out he quite literally has to tango with the devil in order to win his partner's soul back. 

The other idea was 'Tech Bro and AI' about a Tech Bro who loved his AI a little too much and wanted to pitch its revolutionary idea to his boss to sell as a commercial product. With the twist that the AI is entirely incompetent and is incapable of doing anything the user asks.

After pitching to the class and gaining some feedback on our ideas we ultimately decided to go with tech bro vs AI. 

### Research

---

After deciding on what kind of short film we would be doing it was time to do a bit of research into similar esq shorts to try and identify what made them humourous and what worked for their comedy.

**EXAMPLE ONE: MEET THE SCOUT**

'Meet the Scout' is a video in Valve's 'Meet The ...' series used to promote characters for the game Team Fortress 2 and often showcase the personality of the character in a really short video. Scout being one of the more comedic characters in the aforementioned game was a good reference point to use for a short skit-like video utilising solely video game animation. The short in its 1 minute 30 runtime effectively establishes its titular character 'The Scout' alongside some of the more slapstick comedy aspects of his personality and in-game traits that would make him be so loveable by fans.

I felt like what made 'Meet the Scout' so effective was its use of constant switching cameras which didn't particularly linger on any one shot for too long without immediately cutting to something else to effectively pull off quick jokes. This almost 'rapid-fire' style of comedy exemplified in this video also allowed for jokes to linger a bit longer whilst still introducing the audience to more jokes which ultimately creates this cohesive story telling method that doesn't overstay its welcome. 

I think that I will attempt to adapt elements of this into my own personal rendition of the cutscene we end up making as something like this video is completely in line with what my group and I have discussed we would like to do for the project.

**EXAMPLE TWO: THE DISASTROUS LIFE OF SAIKI K**

'The Disastrous life of Saiki K' (often shortened to just Saiki K) is a comedy anime that hails from the gag comedy and satire comedy subgenres and uses it to its advantage to create incredibly memorable moments and jokes throughout its two season runtime. With the centre of our idea being about mocking a stereotypical 'Techbro' I felt like Saiki K would provide a perfect reference point when it pertained to seeing how they handled their satire and parody comedy aspects in order to take into account things I could do for my cutscene.

Most of what I gathered from watching a few Saiki K clips in order to garner information on how to create an effective comedy skit is that often playing into a character's stereotypical traits can lead to humour on the end of the audience if you mock preestablished traits that an archetype is known for. Doing that for something like a Techbro would be incredibly easy and with much of the younger generation often hating AI and its implications on the world creating a scenario where the Techbro is humilated and looked down on as a bit of a loser to play into the stereotype that most people of my generation hold about people who excessively obsessed with AI.

**EXAMPLE THREE: The Stanley Parable**

Whilst not your conventional comedy, 'The Stanley Parable' has cemented itself in internet culture as being a hilariously sad game, with its twist ending and general darker undertones, it is often overlooked just how well the comedy of this game is written to support the contrast of the twist endings and the general surface level story that's being told to the player upon first time playthroughs.

Stanley Parable pulls from the meta-comedy and dark humour subgenres to create what is an incredibly memorable experience for anyone playing blind. It uses a large series of incredibly blunt and obvious story telling to create an almost comedic undertone which has the player chuckling at the almost obvious nature of a lot of the jokes in the game. It perfectly matches the mundane and dread of the setting of the game, being an office building, as the main character, Stanley, navigates this story setup by the disembodied narrator.

Stanley Parable has a lot to take away from in terms of how I can use it to further my own cutscene, with its office setting and blunt joke telling being core aspects of its comedy and also fitting into my cutscene's setting of a work environment too. It might be great to have supporting characters in the cutscene showcasing almost dread and blunt tiredness to contrast the techbro's almost upbeat and child-like excited nature of his AI. 

### Script Writing

Before concluding our activities we eventually decided to get a basic script down and work on our shotlist document to pretty clearly plan out what the cutscene would look like and what we would need to record for our motion capture in the second week.
